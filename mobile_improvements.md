# Mobile UI/UX Improvements

I have optimized the Convobelt website for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience across all screen sizes.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Responsive Navigation**
- **Mobile Menu**: Implemented a hamburger menu for mobile screens.
- **Functionality**: Tapping the menu icon opens a smooth dropdown containing all navigation links and the "Request Demo" button.
- **Interaction**: The menu automatically closes when a link is clicked, providing a fluid user experience.

### 2. **Hero Section Optimization**
- **Spacing**: Adjusted top padding (`pt-24`) for mobile devices to prevent the content from being pushed too far down.
- **Layout**: Ensured the headline, subheadline, and buttons stack vertically and are easily tappable.

### 3. **Component Responsiveness**
- **Clients Section**: Logos wrap naturally on smaller screens.
- **Problem Section**: The grid layout switches to a single column, making the "Chaos" visualization and text easy to read.
- **Solution Section**: The timeline steps stack vertically, ensuring the process flow is clear without horizontal scrolling.
- **Features Grid**: Cards stack in a single column for better readability.

## Verification
I have verified these changes by simulating a mobile device (iPhone X size) and confirming that:
- The menu opens and closes correctly.
- All text is readable without zooming.
- No horizontal scrolling is required.
- Touch targets (buttons, links) are appropriately sized.

The website is now fully responsive and mobile-friendly!
