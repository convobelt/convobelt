# Convobelt Landing Page - Light Theme Update

I have successfully updated the Convobelt landing page to a **Light Theme** as requested, integrating the **Red Brand Color** from your logo.

## Updates Implemented

### 1. **Light Theme Transition**
- **Backgrounds**: Switched from `slate-950` (dark) to `white` and `slate-50` (light gray) for a clean, modern industrial look.
- **Typography**: Updated text colors to `slate-900` (primary) and `slate-600` (secondary) for optimal readability on light backgrounds.
- **Borders**: Softened borders to `slate-200` to maintain structure without being harsh.

### 2. **Brand Color Integration**
- **Primary Accent**: Replaced **Safety Orange** with **Brand Red** (`#dc2626`) to match your logo.
- **Usage**: The new red is used for:
  - Primary Buttons
  - "Cut Size" emphasis in the headline
  - Icons in the Features Grid
  - Critical alerts in the Problem Section
  - Selection highlight color

### 3. **Component Updates**
- **Navbar**: Now features a white glassmorphism effect with the new **Image Logo**.
- **Hero Section**: The conveyor belt animation now runs on a light background with a subtle grid pattern.
- **Problem Section**: The "Chaos" visualization has been adapted to light mode, maintaining the red "Critical Error" aesthetics.
- **Solution & Features**: Cards now use white backgrounds with subtle shadows and hover effects.

## How to Run
