# Convobelt Landing Page

I have successfully built the high-converting landing page for Convobelt, following your "Industrial Tech" design aesthetic and requirements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Industrial Tech Design**
- **Dark Mode Dominant**: Used `slate-950` and `slate-900` for a deep, industrial background.
- **High-Contrast Accents**: Integrated **Safety Orange** (`#f97316`) for primary actions and **Electric Blue** (`#0ea5e9`) for system status indicators.
- **Typography**: Used **Inter** for clean readability and **Roboto Mono** for technical data points.

### 2. **Interactive Elements (Framer Motion)**
- **Hero Animation**: A custom-built conveyor belt visualization with moving items and scanning effects.
- **Scroll Animations**: Sections fade in and slide up as you scroll.
- **Chaos Visualization**: The "Problem" section features a chaotic animation of scattered elements to represent the "Cut Size" crisis.
- **Hover Effects**: Cards and buttons have subtle interactions to make the interface feel alive.

### 3. **Component Structure**
- **Navbar**: Sticky glassmorphism header with navigation and CTA.
- **Hero**: Impactful headline with the animated conveyor belt visual.
- **Problem Section**: visually contrasts the "Chaos" of mold-driven production.
- **Solution Section**: A clean, vertical timeline showing the "Plan-Driven" process.
- **Features Grid**: 3-column layout highlighting key capabilities with hover effects.
- **Footer**: Final CTA and contact links.

## Tech Stack
